## Instructions: 

## 1. Excel: 

o Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.

Using PivotTables to analyze customer data for subscription pattern is an effective way to uncover trends and insights.

a.  Analyze Subscription Patterns:  This analysis helps to understand how many customers are subscribed to each subscription type or plan

c.  Subscription Trends over Time:  How subscriptions have changed over time, to know the number of new subscribers per month or year

![S over time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e59203f3-ae3b-4491-b91c-677aef956f5c)

d.  Revenue Analysis by Subscription Plan:  To analyze the revenue generated by different subscription plans

![revenue analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6facc16d-8e78-4cf7-b695-f67de276d7fa)

e.  Regional Analysis of Subscription Patterns:  The data includes customer regions and to analyze how subscriptions vary across different locations

![regional analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ac1756-e2ff-4cf6-ad53-b2efc2f64dde)

This provides insights into geographic patterns, such as which regions have the most subscribers or which plans are popular in certain areas

f.  Subscription Renewal:  To analyze subscription renewal, compare the number of active vs. cancelled subscriptions over a period


![subscription renewal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/509827d9-4381-47bc-ad59-81aff51681a3)


o Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types. 

o Create any other interesting reports

# Pivort Charts for Visualization

![38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5de33e-1d4e-4e4c-aa10-af5bc20188d8)

o  find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months. 

To find the customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months, I need to identify the relevant tables and columns that store the cancellation information, including;

1.  Customer Identification: Usually a ```CustomerID```
2.  Cancellation Date: A column that records when the subscription was canceled that's ```CancelDate```
3.  Start Date: The date when the subscription started that's ```StartDate```

```
SELECT CustomerId, DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) AS DurationInMonths
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData$]
WHERE Canceled = 1
AND DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) <= 6; 
```

![39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ae91901-1f80-443d-a633-c90f5b96fcbf)

o  calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.

The duration of each customers subscription by substracting the subscription strart date from the cancellation date

```
SELECT AVG(SubscriptionDuration) AS AverageSubscriptionDuration
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData$];
```

![40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0439d487-ca77-4f67-9b1f-fd3b7f4b202a)


o  find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months. 

To find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months, I need to calcullate the duration of each customer's subscription by comparing the ```SubscriptionStart``` of the subscription to either the ```Canceled```

```
SELECT CustomerId, SubscriptionDuration AS DurationInMonths
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData$]
WHERE Canceled = 1
AND SubscriptionDuration > 12;
```

![41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a3f21d0-0a92-47c1-b47e-bbc2dbe2f71e)


o  calculate total revenue by subscription type. 

To calculate total revenue by subcription type, I typically have a table that includes subscription details, including a column for the subscription type and a column for the revenue generated form each subscription

A table called ```CustomerData``` with the following relevant columns;

1.  ```SubscriptionType```:  The type of subscription (e.g. Basic, Standard, Premium)
2.  ```Revenue```:  The revenue generated from each subscription


```
SELECT SubscriptionType,
SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
[dbo].[CustomerData$]

o  find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations. 

To find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations, I typically need to have a table that includes the following;

1.  Region:  The geographical area where the customer is located
2.  Canceled:  The date when the subscription was canceled

```
SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(CustomerId) AS NumberofCancellations
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData$]
WHERE Canceled = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY Region

o  find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.

To find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions. I typically need to identify the relevant columns in my customerdata table. The key columns will usually include;

1.  Canceled:  The date the subscription was canceled
2.  CustomerID:  or a similar identifier to count subcriptions

```
SELECT CASE
WHEN Canceled = 1 THEN 'True'
WHEN Canceled = 0 THEN 'False'

# POWERBI

Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends. Include slicers for interactive analysis


## Objectives;


## 1.  Total Subscription

To calculate and analyze **Total Subscriptions** I focus on the total count of active subscriptions across various sunscription types and customer segments

Using this formular by creating a measure; ```Total Subscriptions = COUNT('CustomerData'[CustomerID])```


## Insights

Analyzing Total Subscriptions helps in understanding the overall health and growth of your customer base. 


## 2.  Sum of Revenue by Subscription Type and Region

The objective of this analysis is to provide an overview of total revenue generated by different subscription types across regions. It allows us to identify high-performing regions and subscription preferences that       could inform targeted sales and marketing strategies.

i.  Total Revenue by Subscription Type:  To understand customer preferences and revenue contributions, I first look at revenue generated from each subscription type (e.g. Monthly, Annual, Quartely)

ii.  Total Revenue by Region: Breaking down revenue by region helps identify geographic areas with higher customer engagement and spending. 

iii.  Combined Analysis of Revenue by Subscription Type and Region: Analyzing revenue by both subscription type and region provides a more detailed view of regional preferences 

## Insights

While the East Region has strong revenue contributions from annual subscriptions with over (25.11%) other regions could benefit from tailored strategies to driive annual plan adoption. Providing limited-time discounts or bundled offers in regions where monthly subscriptions dominitae may help transition customers to longer-term plans, resulting in increased revenue stability. 


## 3.  Subscription Status

It typically refers to the current state of a customer's subscription, providing insights into whether a subscription is active or canceled. Analyzing subscription status is essential for understanding customer engagement, tracking cancelations and identifying retention trends.

Types of Subscription Statuses

i.  Active:  Currently subscribed and receiving service

ii.  Canceled:  Subscription has been actively canceled by the customer

Note:  Each status can help to assess the current state of customer engagement and determine areas for intervention 

Recommendations
i.  Improve Retention Strategies:  For Regions or subscription types with high cancelations, introduce retention offers or survey customers to understand their reasons for leaving

ii.  Focus on Renewal Campaigns:  To reduce expired subscriptions, create renewal reminders or special offers near the expiration date

iii.  Optimize Onboarding:  If a significant number of subcriptions are pending, streamline the activation process to improve customer experience. 


Understanding and tracking  subscription status allows you to maintain customer relationships, improve retention and refine renewal efforts. 


## 4.  Count of CustomerID by Subscription Type

This analysis helps you understand customer preferences and the distribution of customers across various subscription plans


## Insights

i.  Popular Subscription Types:  Identify which subcription types have the highest customer counts, showing preference patterns

ii.  Retention and Churn:  For subscription types with lower customer counts, analyze if higher churn is a factor and explore ways to enhance customer satisfaction

This approach helps to explore customer distribution across different subscription types, allowing for targeted marketing or retention strategies based on customer preferences.


## 5.  Subscription Type, Start and End

To analyze and interpret subscription Type, Subscription Start and Subscription End data, to gain valuable insights into customer subscription behaviour, durations and renewal patterns.

i.  Subscription Type:  Identifies the type or plan of subscription 

ii.  Subscription Start:  The date the subscription began

iii.  Subscription End:  The date the subscription is set to end or has ended if not renewed

This approach provides a comprehensive view of subcription behaviours, helps predict customer needs, and supports data-driven strategies to increase retention and optimize revenue


## 6.  Total Subscription by Region

Using the Map Visual, this approach provides a geographic visualization of subscription distribution, making it easy to identify high and low performing regions at a glance and a map visual provides a clear, interactive way to understand geographic trends in subscriptions, making it an effective tool for targeting regional strategies. 


## 7.  Insights from Average Subscription Duration

i.  Longer Duration in Annual Plans:  If annual subscriptions have a higher average duration it may indicate greater commitment. 

By analyzing the average subscription duration, I can identiify patterns in customer loyalty and retention, helping to strategies on how to enhance customer engagement. 


## 8.  Total Revenue

```TotalRevenue = SUM(CustomerData[Revenue])```

This approach provides a clear view of revenue performance, aiding in financial planning and strategic decision-making


## 9.  Top 10 Customers by Revenue

To identify the TOP 10 Customers by Revenue by creating a measure for total reveneue per customer and then use this measure to rank and visualize the top customers. 

```Rank by Revenue = RANKX(ALL('CustomerData'[CustomerName]),[TotalRevenue], ,DESC,Dense)```


## Insights from Top 10 Customers Analysis

i.  Key Revenue Drivers:  Identify which customers are generating the most revenue

ii.  Customer Relationships:  Understanding who the top customers are can guide relationship management and service enhancements

iii.  Potential Upselling Opportunities:  Analyze the profiles of top customers to identify potential upselling or cross-selling opportunities based on their purchasing patterns

This approach helps to analyze and visualize the top customers by revenue, giving insights to drive strategic business decisions. 


## 10.  Count of CustomerID by Subscription Status

To calculate the Count of Customer IDs by Subscription Status, I have a Subscription Status field that indicates whether a subscription is **Active** or **Cancel**


## Insights from Count of CustomerID by Subscription Status

i.  Customer Retention:  A high number of active subscriptions compared to canceled ones indicate strong customer retention

ii.  Churn Analysis:  If the count of canceled subscriptions is high there will be a need to investigate the reasons for churn and implement retention strategies 

iii.  Targeted Marketing:  Use insights from the counts to design targeted campaigns aimed at re-engaging canceled customers or upselling to active ones

This insights will help to track and analyze customer distribution across different subscription statuses.


## 11.  Total Subscriptions by Subscription Type

This will give you a clear overview of the distribution of subcriptions by type to make data-driven decisions


## 12.  Average Subscription Duration by Subscription Type

i.  Engagement Metrics:  Longer average durations in certain subscription types may indicate higher customer satisfaction and engagement

ii.  Marketing Strategies:  Understanding which subscription types have shorter durations can guide targeted retention strategies and marketing efforts

iii.  Subscription Performance:  Analyze if certain subscription types are performing better over time, influencing future pricing or promotional strategies


## 13.  Count of CustomerID by Month

i.  Customer Growth Trends:  I can observe trends over time to see if customer counts are increasing or decreasing monthly

ii.  Seasonal Patterns:  Identify any seasonal fluctuations in customer acquisitions or retention

iii.  Marketing Effectiveness:  Analyze how marketing campaigns impact customer growth by looking at the counts before and after specific intiatives 


By visualizing the Count of CustomerIDs by Month, there is more insights in Customer acquisitions trends and overall business growth
